## Assembly instructions
- carefully depanelize the PCB by bending it
- optionally file or sand the rough edges
- pay attention to the orientation of the battery holder and the LEDs
- carefully bend the LED leads and solder them in place before assembling the plane
- slide the wings over the leg of the body
- pay attention to the polarity marks on the plane body and the baseplate
- solder the mechanical joints on one side first. This will allow you to make easy corrections when it's not perfectly perpendicular
